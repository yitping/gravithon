= List of Functions/Routines =

What functions/routines do we need?

 * syntax
  * a "Hello, world!" function -- DONE
 * file I/O
  * a function to unmerge a merged FITS file
  * read (part of) a GRAVITY FITS file into useful Python structures, e.g. numpy arrays and dictionaries
 * observation planning
  * (u,v) plot routine, star altitude + airmass plot -- ideally with a direct interface to SIMBAD to get the object coordinates
  * simple interferometry modeling tools (point sources, binaries, (elliptical) Gaussians, uniform disks, ...)
  * Fourier transforms of arbitrary images
